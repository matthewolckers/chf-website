Website for Stellenbosch University's Centre for Household Finance


Notes on changes needed:

- Working on fonts
    - SU website supplies ttd fonts but apparently woff fonts are recommended. Need to see if we can find this. 
    - For now I just used the Google Raleway font
    - I also need to change the backup font to Trebuchet as specified in the brand guidelines.
